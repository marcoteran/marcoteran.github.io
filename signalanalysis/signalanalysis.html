        <p><em>Assistant professor at <strong><a href="https://www.usergioarboleda.edu.co/">Universidad Sergio Arboleda</a></strong> and S&H designer at <strong>CEA-IoT</strong>.</em></p>

        <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on the
          interaction of algorithms and networks, and the roles they play in
          large-scale social and information systems. My work has been supported
          by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur
          Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons
          Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, and grants from
          Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF.
          I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy
          of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

        About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
            entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
            introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites.
            To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are
            supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>

          <li>This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we
            both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate
